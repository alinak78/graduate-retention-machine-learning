# Predict Graduate Student retention using Machine Learning

Developed a machine learning framework to predict student dropout risk using demographic, socioeconomic, and academic data. Employed models such as logistic regression and random forests, achieving 79.27% accuracy after applying SMOTE for class balancing. Conducted feature engineering to analyze key predictors, including tuition status and curricular unit performance, providing actionable insights for early intervention strategies to improve retention rates.
